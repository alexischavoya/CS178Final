These tools help in two ways for project53:
1) It runs the program autonomously without opening shells or closing them
2) It auto submits to gradescope

## Models

<p>A table listing each model, as well as your best blended/stacked model
ensembles, and their performance on your own training & validation data,
and the public & private leaderboard data if available (2-4 numbers).</p>

| Model Name  | Performance Rating  | Leaderboard Rank  |
|---|---|---|
| \<model name 1>  |   |   |
| \<model name 2>  |   |   |
| \<model name 3>  |   |   |
| \<model name 4>  |   |   |
| \<model name 5>  |   |   |
| \<model name 6>  |   |   |


### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 1></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 2></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 3></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 4></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 5></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

### <span style="color:blue">\<model name 6></span>
For each model, a paragraph or two describing:  what features you gave it
(raw inputs, selected inputs, non-linear feature expansions, etc.); how
was it trained (learning algorithm and software source); and key
hyperparameter settings (plus your approach to choosing those settings).

## Overall Ensemble
<p> A paragraph or two describing your overall prediction ensemble:
how did you combine the individual models, and why did you pick that
technique?</p>

## Conclusion
<p>A conclusion paragraph highlighting the methods/algorithms that you
think worked particularly well for this data, the methods/algorithms
that worked poorly, and your hypotheses as to why.</p>
